## How does it work? 🤔

Whenever you have to complete a task requiring your undivided attention just use this tool to boost your focus and productivity. It's really simple!
1. Start the timer and get to work.
2. After 25 minutes take a 5 minute break. (interval lengths are fully customizable in the application settings)
3. Every 4th interval take a longer break to recharge your batteries, but worry not — Pomodorek will adjust the next interval length for you!
4. Continue until your assignment is complete.

In time you will be able to accurately estimate how many intervals certain task take to complete. This will further help you organize your time and resources to achieve desired goals.

## About the technique
Pomodoro Technique® is a time managment technique that splits time reserved for work into intervals and short rest periods between them. Every four intervals the break is significantly longer to further help yourself recharge energy before going into another focus session.
